## Overview

## Summary
Theme 3 investigates language as the product of social interaction between individuals. First, it seeks to identify the evolutionary drivers that pushed early hominids to transition from primate-like signalling to human-like linguistic communication. Second, it aims at exploring the future of language, notably the impact of machine language on natural languages and their developments. Machines are increasingly replacing social functions in both language acquisition and processing, but the impact of these developments on human linguistic behaviour is largely unknown. 

#### The Sociality project
The central goal of the Sociality project is to shed light on the role of social interactions in driving the ontogeny of communicative competence across species. The project explores the role of directed and surrounding acts of communication in human and nonhuman primate infants and so to identify their relative importance in language ontogeny and phylogeny.

#### The Cooperation project
The Cooperation project explores the relation between human hyper-cooperation and the origins of language. It investigates this relationship at three different levels of analysis â€” cognitive, behavioural and communicative processes.

#### The Digitisation project
The Digitisation focuses on the future of language. It explores the impact of language technology and artificial languages on human linguistic intuitions, mental  representations and speech output.
