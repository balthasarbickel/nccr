The Swiss National Centre of Comptence in Research (NCCR) Evolving Language is a nationwide interdisciplinary research consortium bringing together research groups from the humanities, from language and computer science, the social sciences,  and the natural sciences at an unprecedented level. Together, we aim at solving one of humanity’s great mysteries: How did our species develop the ca­pa­city for linguistic expression, for processing language in the brain, and for con­sist­ently passing down new variations to the next generation? How will our capacity for language change in the face of digital com­munication and neuroengineering? 

Evolving Language is led by Balthasar Bickel (Department of Comparative Linguistics, UZH), Anne-Lise Giraud (Department of Basic Neurosciences, University of Geneva) and Klaus Zuberbühler (Institute of Biology, University of Neuchâtel). Over 30 research groups across Switzerland are taking part in this NCCR, from 9 different institutions as well as partners in industry (Google AI, Sonova) and public organizations:

<!-- The NCCR is supported by the Swiss Federation and based at the University of Zurich (primary home institution; 17 research groups) and at the University of Geneva (second home institution; 10 research groups). The national network also involves three research groups at the University of Neuchâtel, two research groups at the ETH Zurich, two research groups at the EPF Lausanne, as well as a research group at the universities of Basel, Fribourg and Lausanne. The artificial intelligence research institute IDIAP (Institut Dalle Molle d’intelligence artificielle perceptive, Martigny) is also involved in the project with two research groups. -->
