The Swiss National Centre of Comptence in Research (NCCR) Evolving Language is a nationwide interdisciplinary research network bringing together research groups from the humanities, biology, neurosciences, psychology and computer sciences. 

The NCCR is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and based at the University of Zurich (primary home institution; 17 research groups) and at the University of Geneva (second home institution; 10 research groups). The national network also involves three research groups at the University of Neuchâtel, two research groups at the ETH Zurich, two research groups at the EPF Lausanne, as well as a research group at the universities of Basel, Fribourg and Lausanne. The artificial intelligence research institute IDIAP (Institut Dalle Molle d’intelligence artificielle perceptive, Martigny) is also involved in the project with two research groups.
