## Summary

Theme 2 tackles language as a product of the brain, an exceedingly complex information processing system implemented in a biological tissue. Language has evolved in parallel with a rapid growth of two brain regions, the prefrontal cortex and posterior temporal areas, in particular in the left cerebral hemisphere. The overarching question of Theme 2 prolongs this basic evolutionary observation by asking what cognitive operations and neural principles might have accompanied the development and specific interactions of these brain regions, affording both the capacity to produce and process streams of meaningful complex sounds, and the quasi infinite combinatorial possibilities of language. 

#### The Reception project
The Reception project tackles two fundamental issues of continuous speech perception: (1) how to chunk continuous speech into basic linguistic elements, and to encode these elements while maintaining both their sequentiality and their hierarchical relations, and (2) how prosodic cues (including rhythm) contribute to meaning and syntax extraction in speech.

#### The Production project
The Generation project then addresses the neural bases of speech planning from abstract syntax to articulation. It seeks to understand both the nature of structural and computational hierarchies as cardinal mechanisms in language (planning) and cognition at large, and the ontogeny of speech motor control as a partial model of its phylogeny.

#### The Variability project
Finally the Variability project addresses an essential issue of language as a biological product, namely the variability in its expression, spanning from physiology to pathology.
