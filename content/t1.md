## Summary

Theme 1 of the NCCR aims at developing a dynamic understanding of linguistic structures in two specific ways: First, it seeks to model linguistic structure in biologically plausible terms. Second, it aims at capturing the inter-generational dynamics of linguistic structures, i.e. their ontogeny and diachrony. For the first phase of Evolving Language, three projects will address core aspects of language structure. 

#### The Grammar project
The Grammar project tackles the basic mechanisms that structure communicative expressions, i.e. the mechanisms of combination and division that distinguish a given expression from a holistic signal. The project systematically compares mechanisms in human and animal communication, seeking to identify precisely which mechanisms continue earlier phylogenetic patterns and which ones are evolutionarily derived, either specifically for language or by exaptation.


#### The Diversification project
The Diversification project will develop refined models of how human and animal communication systems and their structures diversify over time and space, taking (genetic) population history and geographical environments into account. A specific test case is the evolution of arbitrary vs motivated forms or expression and signalling.


#### The Computation project
The Computation project takes up the prospect for biologically plausible models of language, fully embracing the temporal deployment and probabilistic information flow that characterizes how language works. We take neurobiologically detectable mechanisms as a starting point and work our way to the corresponding computations.
