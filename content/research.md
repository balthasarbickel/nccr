Language is what sets humans apart from all other species. Despite much effort, however, its evolutionary origins have remained obscure. At the same time, the role of language is currently undergoing radical changes, with cultural, psychological and evolutionary ramifications barely understood. New digital channels, ubiquitous online knowledge bases, and continued advancement of artificial intelligence are reshaping our communicative environment and modifying the way we learn and use language. An indepth exploration of the origins and future of language is urgently needed, propelling language science to the forefront of societal and economic challenges.

Our project explores the evolutionary origins and future development of linguistic communication with an unprecedented transdisciplinary research programme. We conceptualise language as a system of components
with distinct evolutionary trajectories and adopt a large-scale comparative framework to study these trajectories in nature and function along three thematic axes:
1. The Dynamic Structures of Language: How and why have the structures of language and their temporal dynamics evolved? How will these structures interact with new technologies and means of communication?

2. The Biological Substrates of Language: What are the biological mechanisms that make language possible? Can and should we intervene on language functions with neurotechnology?

3. The Social Cognition of Language: What are the social cognitive mechanisms that underlie linguistic communication, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically? How did these mechanisms evolve and how will they change with artificial communicators?
