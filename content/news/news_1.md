Baring possible further decisions by the SERI or the SNSF, the starting date of the NCCR has been postponed to June 1, 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. The earliest timepoint for hiring scientific staff is one month after the start date. Since this is just before the summer break, most projects will take off only by September 1.
