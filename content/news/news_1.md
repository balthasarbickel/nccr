Baring possible further decisions by the SERI or the SNSF, the starting date of the NCCR has been postponed to June 1, 2020. The earliest timepoint for hiring scientific staff is one month after the start date. Since this is just before the summer break, PIs are strongly recommended to have their team members start as of September 1, 2020 or later. Please consider updating your advertisements accordingly or postpone new ones. If you should have any questions, please contact Eliza (eliza.isabaeva@uzh.ch).
